**Water It** — Last updated: February 8, 2026

## What the app does

Water It is a personal plant care companion that helps you track your plants, set watering reminders, and view local weather. All plant data is stored locally on your device.

## Data we collect

### Location (optional)
If you choose to enable the weather feature, the app requests your device location or a city name you enter. Your approximate coordinates (latitude and longitude) are sent to the OpenWeatherMap API solely to retrieve local weather forecasts. We do not store, log, or share your location on any server we control.

For details on how OpenWeatherMap handles data, see their privacy policy: https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy

### Photos (optional)
If you choose to add photos to your plants, images are captured using your device camera and stored locally on your device. Photos are never uploaded to any server.

### Plant data
All plant information (names, descriptions, watering schedules, reminders) is stored locally in an on-device database. This data never leaves your device.

### Notifications
The app may schedule local notifications to remind you to water your plants. These are processed entirely on your device and do not involve any external service.

## Data we do NOT collect

- No personal information (name, email, account)
- No analytics or usage tracking
- No advertising identifiers
- No crash reporting to external services
- No cookies or web tracking

## Third-party services

| Service | Data sent | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| OpenWeatherMap | Latitude, longitude | Weather forecast |

No other third-party services receive any data from the app.

## Data storage and security

All app data is stored locally on your device using an SQLite database and shared preferences. We do not operate any servers or cloud storage. Uninstalling the app deletes all associated data.

## Children's privacy

Water It does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. The app does not require account creation or collect identifying information from any user.
